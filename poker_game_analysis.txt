Hi everyone, I created a description of the actual "playing" of a seven card poker. Please feel free to make any ajustments. I'm going to add more detail and make things consistent with what Mike had done in his "table.js" example. -Naomi 

Before playing
	1. Ask number of players.
	2. Ask what kind of poker.
	3. Ask player's names.
	4. Determine seating position.
	5. Players put antes in the pot.
	6. Play!

How to Play
	1. Shuffle the cards.
	2. Deal the first two round of cards face down.
	3. Deal one card face up for round 2, 3, 4, and 5, face down for round 6.
	4. Do one round of betting/playing (this will be expanded later in more details).
	5. Unless game is over (either only one player remains, or round 6 is finished), repeat 3 and 4 until game over or round 6.
	6. Determine the winner: last player remaining or the player with the highest ranking hand after round 6.
	7. The winner takes the pot.
	8. Ask: Play again?
	- If yes, go back to 1.
	- If no, end of game.

One Round Of Betting/Playing
	1. Determine whose turn it is.
	2. Ask the player to choose from the 4 choices: pass (only available if the previous play was pass), bet, raise, or fold. 
		a. If player passes, give turn to next player clockwise.
		b. If player bets, ask betting amount, move that amount from that player to the pot, then give turn to the next player clockwise.
		c. If player raises, ask amount, move that amount from that player to the pot, then give turn to the next player clockwise.
		d. If player folds, reduce number of players by 1, and then remove the player's name from list and then move turn to the next player clockwise.
	3. Repeat 2 until reaching the end of the round in one of the following scenarios:
		a. If everyone passes.
		b. If someone bets and everyone folds or matches.
		c. If one person raises, and everyone either folds, matches.
		d. If all but one person fold.
