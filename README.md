# Beginner Project, Christmas 2017/18

This repository, while public, is really meant as a playground for the kids that are going to make their first collaborative game project during Christmas break, 2017.

## Folder Structure

 - `mikes_example`
   - This is where Hessong's and Sejong's dad put an example poker game in the repository, to give an idea of the following:
       - Programming even fairly simple things is **complicated**, be sure to create a **SIMPLE PROGRAM** that you can all collectively get done in a couple of weeks.  If you really love doing this, there is always more time and you can try something more complicated later.  This is **really** just to get you started.
       - By using my code as an example, you can understand how to break components up.  For instance, there is an *object* that is a deck, upon which we can do things like shuffle, and we can *expose* this object by exporting it, so that other files can use it.
 - `app`
   - You all can rename this whatever you want, but the idea is that you should put all of your code into a sub-directory below this parent level.
